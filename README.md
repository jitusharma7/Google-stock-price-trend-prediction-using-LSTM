 ## Problem_Definition
 We have a Google stock price dataset from 2012 to 2016. We will try to predict the trend of the stock price for Jan 2017 stock price 
 


## Data_Preprocessing
1. Feature Scaling
2. Created data structure with 60 timesteps and 1 output
3. Reshape the training dataset


## Building_LSTM
### Steps to Build LSTM  Neural Network
1. Import required libraries
2. Initialize RNN 
3. Adding 4 LSTM layer and some Dropout regularisation
4. Fully connected layer and output layer

## Model_Building
### Steps to model Building
1. Compile the RNN model
2. Training the LSTM on the Training set



## Result
* LSTM  is preferred for predict the trend of any company stock price.
* Analyzed the trend of predicted and actual stock price prediction.
