 ## Problem_Definition
 We have Google stock price dataset from 2012 to 2016. We will try to predcit trend of stock price for Jan 2017 stoick price 
 


## Data_Preprocessing
1. Feature Scaling
2. Createda data structure with 60 timesteps and 1 output
3. Reshape the training dataset


## Building_LSTM
### Steps to Build LSTM  Neural Netwrok
1. Import required libraries
2. Initialize RNN 
3. Adding 4 LSTM layer and some Dropout regularisation
4. Fully connected layer and output layer

## Model_Building
### Steps to model Building
1. Compile the RNN model
2. Training the LSTM on Training set



## Result
1. The accuracy of model  is 96.82%. The accuaracy of model should be next to 100% in medical domain problems .


## Business_Recommendation
* LSTM  is the  prefer  for predict trend of any comapny stock price.
* Analyzed the trend of predcited and actual stock price prediction.
